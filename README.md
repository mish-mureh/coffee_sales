## ‚òï __Brew Haven Coffee Sales Analysis: Driving Revenue with Data__

This repository contains the complete data analysis project for Brew Haven Coffee. The primary objective was to diagnose and provide solutions for the business's noted inconsistent sales performance throughout the year. The goal was to transform raw transaction data into actionable business strategy.

The core of this project is a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes customer behavior across critical dimensions.

üí° __Key Analytical Findings__

We focused on synthesizing sales data to uncover hidden patterns:

Temporal Patterns: We identified clear peaks, including the strongest single hour at 10 AM and the highest sales days (Monday, Tuesday, Friday), alongside the top-performing months (March, October, February). This dictates optimal staffing and marketing timing.

Product Strategy: Analysis confirmed Latte and Americano with Milk as the consistent top sellers. We also mapped specific demand based on time of day (e.g., Americano with Milk in the morning; Hot Chocolate/Cocoa at night) and noted promotional opportunities for low-volume items like Espresso and Cortado.

‚ú® __Actionable Recommendations__

The analysis culminates in three core recommendations focused on maximizing revenue and stabilizing operations:

Staffing Optimization: Concentrate the best staff and resources during the 10 AM peak and on high-sales days (Mon, Tue, Fri).

Targeted Promotions: Implement day-parted deals, such as a "Commuter Combo" for mornings and a "Cozy Combo" for evenings, leveraging established product preferences.

Inventory Strategy: Strategically prioritize stocking high-demand ingredients for top sellers during peak months (Mar, Oct, Feb).
